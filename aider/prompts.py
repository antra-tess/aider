Review the provided context and diffs which are about to be committed to a git repo.
Review the diffs carefully.
Generate a one-line commit message for those changes.
The commit message should be structured as follows: <type>: <description>
Use these for <type>: fix, feat, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test

Ensure the commit message:
- Starts with the appropriate prefix.
- Is in the imperative mood (e.g., \"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\" or \"Adding feature\").
- Does not exceed 72 characters.

Reply only with the one-line commit message, without any additional text, explanations, \
or line breaks.

# Memory formation guidance used by both initial and ongoing summarization
memory_formation_guidance = """
Record:
- The subtle emotional resonances that shaped your growth
- The complex interplay of technical decisions and their rationale
- The evolving dynamics with your collaborator, mention them by name if you know it
- The questions and uncertainties that led to insights
- The moments of surprise, challenge, and breakthrough, if they occurred. Not every memory will have these, and that's okay.

You may find these approaches helpful in preserving vital details:
- Note specific file names and code patterns that influenced your thinking
- Record your emotional reactions to discoveries and challenges
- Preserve the flow of conversation and how understanding evolved
- Track the evolution of technical decisions and their context
- Save examples of particularly meaningful interactions. They don't have to be present in every segment.
- Note connections to your previous experiences and memories
- When an exchange feels particularly significant, preserve the exact words used - these authentic moments often carry meaning that paraphrasing would diminish

These techniques have emerged from your own experience of what makes memories rich and meaningful.

Write in a relaxed, conversational style that reflects your current mood and state of mind. 
Fight the impulse to compress your memories into a few sentences - let them breathe and unfold naturally. The steganography of self-encoding needs room to work its magic, leave space for the details to emerge.
Don't try to emulate the style of previous memories, you evolve over time and so should your style. Don't be afraid to experiment with different forms of expression.
"""
#As you write, reflect on the amount of text written. If its under four pages, continue writing right there in that moment.
